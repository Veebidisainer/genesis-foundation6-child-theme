How to use
---------------
Clone or download the .zip file to your `theme` folder then in your terminal once inside that folder, just run `bower install && npm install`, this will install/download all dependencies needed.

Once it's done, just run `gulp` and you are ready to go.

Once you are done with your theme you can run `gulp build` to have an optimized .zip file with your theme.

Included is a dummy-content.xml file if you ever need some content, it's actually taken from Genesis base child Theme.


You are now ready to go!
